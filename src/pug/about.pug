                p The installation of any submarine infrastructure on the seabed requires a geohazard study, a green light from the geoscientist to the submarine engineer to continue the project. This study is grounded in geological and geotechnical data acquired in situ, and on the interpretation of geophysical data.

                p Shallowgeo® masters QA/QC, processing and modeling of acoustic and magnetic data, and since 2018 we have used these skills on several projects in the US East Coast and the Irish Sea, making possible analyses of manmade and geological hazards in cable routes and wind farm arrays. Our efforts are to ensure data quality during geophysical and geotechnical acquisition campaigns while providing support for data acceptance of Governmental Departments such as BOEM (Bureau Ocean Energy Management). We had a decisive participation in seven wind farms in the US East Coast and the Irish Sea:

                p With expertise in seismic processing, we design workflows oriented to the removal of artifacts created by strong weather variations in shallow water environments. The challenge of improving image resolution encourages us to develop innovative tools using artificial intelligence.
